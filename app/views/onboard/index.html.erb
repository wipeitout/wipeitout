<h2>Which one are you?</h2>

<p>
  In the spirit of our anti-boycott approach, we’d like to credit the progressive businesses and organisations that
  have already joined the toilet paper revolution.
</p>

<p>
  They appear in two categories:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Total Wipout – these businesses have already switched to stocking, selling or using recycled toilet paper. If
    this sounds like you or someone you know, tell us about it at onboard@wipeitout.com.au and we’ll flag your good
    services to mankind with a logo at our site
  </li>
  <li>Wiping It Out – these guys are the large retailers like supermarkets, schools, government bodies, corporates and
    even toilet-paper manufacturers that are committed to wiping out the use or sale of non-recycled toilet paper by
    2014
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  That’s right, five years is long enough for an organisation to stage a Wipe Out campaign.
</p>

<h2>5 steps in the pipeline</h2>

<p>
  In 2014, Wipe It Out will engage the help of legal counsel to draft a bill for Parliament mandating that everyone in
  Australia will use 100% recycled toilet paper.
</p>

<p>

  This bill will represent the sentiments of the innovative retailers, businesses and consumers who came on board
  today.
</p>

<p>

  In the lead up to 1 December, 2014 we are targeting five stages of social change:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>By 2010 – 20% of toilet paper sold and purchased in Australia is made of recycled paper; 30% from sustainably
    managed forests (which are 40-year pine plantations)
  </li>
  <li>By 2011 – 40% of toilet paper is made of recycled paper; 30% from sustainably managed forests</li>
  <li>By 2012 – 60% of toilet paper is made of recycled paper; 20% from sustainably managed forests</li>
  <li>By 2013 – 80% of toilet paper paper is made of recycled paper; 10% from sustainably managed forests</li>
  <li>By 2014 – 100% of toilet paper paper is made of recycled paper</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The above is the ‘phase out’ strategies for businesses, including your local supermarket to sign up & commit to. We
  believe they are realistic, sufficiently timed.
</p>

<h2>Those already commited to making a difference</h2>
<p>
  These are some of the businesses who have made the pledge to use 100% recycled toilet paper. If your
  business/company/organisation has also made the switch, or pledge to phase it out by 2014, send us an
  <a href="mailto:onboard@wipeitout.com.au">email</a>.
